 Release X.X.X XXX XXXXXXX XX XXXX
         Security fixes:
+            #562  CVE-2022-25235 -- Passing malformed 2- and 3-byte UTF-8
+                    sequences (e.g. from start tag names) to the XML
+                    processing application on top of Expat can cause
+                    arbitrary damage (e.g. code execution) depending
+                    on how invalid UTF-8 is handled inside the XML
+                    processor; validation was not their job but Expat's.
+                    Exploits with code execution are known to exist.

                     made Expat send malformed tag names to the XML
