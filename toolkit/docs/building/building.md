## Overview

The following documentation describes how to fully build CBL-Mariner end-to-end as well as advanced techniques for performing toolchain, package, or image builds. Full builds of CBL-Mariner _**are not**_ generally needed.  All CBL-Mariner packages are built, signed, and released to an RPM repository at [packages.microsoft.com](https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/2.0/prod/)

If you simply want to test-drive CBL-Mariner, download and install the ISO (see: [readme.md](../../../README.md#iso)).

If you want to experiment with CBL-Mariner, build custom images, or add packages in a more focused environment, refer to the tutorial in the [CBL-MarinerTutorials](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-MarinerTutorials) repository.

The CBL-Mariner build system consists of several phases and tools, but at a high-level, it can be viewed simply as 3 distinct build stages:

- **Toolchain:** This stage gets a set of toolchain RPM packages needed for future steps. It either downloads stable toolchain packages from our package server, or if configured, builds a bootstrap toolchain from scratch and then an official toolchain. Building is highly scripted and serialized in this stage. The official toolchain produced is used in the subsequent package build stage.

- **Package:** This stage uses the toolchain packages from the toolchain stage to build more RPM packages.  Packages are built in parallel during this stage.

- **Image:** This stage generates ISO, VHD, VHDX, container, etc. images from the RPM packages built in the package stage. The images are defined by configuration.json files.

It is possible to invoke any stage at any time. The tooling will automatically invoke earlier stages if needed. Each stage can be built locally, but in many cases the stage can be seeded from pre-built packages and then partially built.

> i.e., you can run `sudo make image ...` and it will implicitly invoke the toolchain and package stages.

If you want a detailed breakdown of how the stages interact, see [How it works](../how_it_works/0_intro.md).

## Building in Stages

The following sections run through a build step-by-step, briefly explaining the purpose of each stage. `make` will generally automate this flow for any target; however, building in stages can be useful for debugging and understanding the build process.

**If you have read about [Stable Tags](#stable-tags),** you can skip to these sections for guidance on specific use-cases:
| Use-case                    | Link                                                     |

### Install Prerequisites

Prepare your system by [installing the necessary prerequisites.](prerequisites.md).

### Clone and Sync to a Stable Commit

Clone the 2.0-stable build of CBL-Mariner as shown here.

```bash
# Get the source code
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner.git

# Make sure to fetch the latest tags
git fetch --tags

cd CBL-Mariner/toolkit

# Checkout the desired release branch. The 2.0-stable tag tracks the most recent successful release of the 2.0 branch.
git checkout 2.0-stable
```

**NOTE: All subsequent commands are assumed to be executed from inside the toolkit directory.**

### Stable Tags

>_**IMPORTANT:**_ The `2.0-stable` tag always points to the last known good build of the `2.0` branch. \
\
A similar tag, `1.0-stable`, exists for the `1.0` branch. \
\
Other branches are also buildable but not guaranteed to be stable.  The `1.0` and `2.0` branches are periodically updated with bug fixes, security vulnerability fixes, or occasional feature enhancements.  As those fixes are integrated into the branch, the head of a branch may be temporarily unstable (i.e., only building using the full bootstrap build from source, rather than hydrating from the package servers). \
\
The `1.0-stable` and `2.0-stable` tags will remain fixed until the tip of the branch is validated and the latest source and binary packages (SRPMs and RPMs) are published.  At that point, the associated `*-stable` tag is advanced. \
\
_**IMPORTANT:**_ To ensure you have the latest tags, invoke `git fetch --tags` before building.

It is also possible to build an older version of CBL-Mariner from the stable branches.  CBL-Mariner may be updated at any time, but an aggregate release is declared monthly and [tagged in GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner/releases).  These monthly builds are stable and their tags can be substituted for the `*-stable` label above.

Other branches are not guaranteed to be easily buildable because these builds would require the SRPMs and/or RPMs be available on our public package repository.  At this time, published files are only available for the `1.0` and `2.0` branches.

#### What About Non-Stable Commits?

Most development work can be done based on the stable tags, but sometimes you need to work on the bleeding edge. There are a few options here:

1) Just rebuild your toolchain every time (set `QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y`). The build tools will attempt to avoid rebuilding the toolchain when possible.
1) Build the toolchain once (see #1), then save a copy of the toolchain you built, and reference it via `TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=my_toolchain.tar.gz`)
1) A hybrid approach: use a stable toolchain via `git checkout 2.0-stable -- ./toolkit/resources/manifests/package/*` on top of a development branch. This will use the latest published toolchain. However, **THIS MAY NOT ALWAYS WORK**. There exist dependency cycles in the packages which are broken by using pre-built toolchain packages. By rolling back the manifests, these cycle-breaking packages may no longer be available.

#### Overview of Branch/Tag Options

These are some of the pros and cons of each approach.

Please also read the [Contribution Guide](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are intending on contributing changes back to CBL-Mariner.

| Branch/Tag        | Pros                 | Cons
|:------------------|:---------------------|------
|`main`             |- Newest packages </br>- No rebase typically required before pull requests </br>- Early warning of dependency issues | - Need to manage your own toolchain </br>- No easy access to pre-built packages </br>- Longer builds
|`1.0-dev`          | Same as `main`       | Same as `main`
|`*-stable`         | - Easy to get pre-built packages </br>- Just download the toolchain | - Need to rebase before pull requests </br>- May mask dependency issues that will occur once rebased onto the development branch
| hybrid approach   | - Best of both        | - May have hard to resolve issues with dependency cycles </br>- Chance that the older toolchain packages hide dependency issues

### Toolchain Stage

The toolchain builds in two sub-phases.  The first phase builds an initial _bootstrap_ toolchain which is then used to build the _official_ toolchain used in package building.  In the first phase, the bootstrap toolchain downloads a series of sources from our source server.  The second uses SRPMS generated from the same sources to build the official RPMs.

For expediency if `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=n` is set, the toolchain will be populated from upstream packages.

#### Populate an Existing Toolchain

A set of bootstrapped toolchain packages (`gcc`, etc.) are used to build CBL-Mariner packages and images.  Rather than build the toolchain, the prebuilt binaries can be downloaded to your local machine.  This happens automatically when the `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=` parameter is set to `n`, which is the default value unless otherwise specified.

```bash
# Populate Toolchain from pre-existing binaries
# This will only work for stable release tags (https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner/releases)
sudo make toolchain REBUILD_TOOLS=y
```

#### Rebuild the Toolchain

Depending on hardware, rebuilding the toolchain can take several hours. A developer should only have to rebuild the toolchain in the following situations:

1) First time building a non-release branch (Pro tip: save the toolchain archive for reuse later)
1) Working on a package found in the [toolchain manifests](../../resources/manifests/package/)
1) Working on the toolchain build tooling itself

There are several optimizations possible to speed up the building of the toolchain. These generally revolve around downloading existing packages from the package server instead of building them from sources.

```bash
# Add REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y to any subsequent command to ensure locally built toolchain packages are used.

# QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y is a fast way to set all relevant optimization flags.
# It implies the following:
#   REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN             = y
#   INCREMENTAL_TOOLCHAIN         = y
#   ALLOW_TOOLCHAIN_DOWNLOAD_FAIL = y
#   REBUILD_TOOLS                 = y
sudo make toolchain QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y
```

The following commands build **the entire toolchain** from scratch without using any pre-built packages. This step can be quite time consuming so make sure to grab a copy of the toolchain if want to skip this step later.

```bash
# Add REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y to any subsequent command to ensure locally built toolchain packages are used
sudo make toolchain REBUILD_TOOLS=y REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y

# Grab a copy of the new toolchain for reuse later.
cp ../build/toolchain/toolchain_built_rpms_all.tar.gz ~/mariner_toolchain.tar.gz
```

### Package Stage

Package building requires the toolchain to be available. The tools will automatically build or download the toolchain if needed.

The CBL-Mariner ecosystem provides a significant number of packages, but most of those packages are not used in an image.  When rebuilding packages, you can choose to build everything, or to save time, you can choose to build packages for your specific image.

The `CONFIG_FILE` argument provides the way to declare what image you want to build. To manually build **all** packages, you can clear the configuration with `CONFIG_FILE=` and invoke the package build target `make build-packages CONFIG_FILE="" ...`.  To build packages needed for a specific image, you must set the `CONFIG_FILE=` parameter to an image configuration file of your choice.  The standard image configuration files are in the [./toolkit/imageconfigs](../../imageconfigs/) folder.

Large parts of the package build stage are parallelized. The `Makefile` components may be parallelized by setting the `-j` flag (`-j$(nproc)` works well). The package build scheduler will automatically schedule one build per core, but this can be overwritten using the `CONCURRENT_PACKAGE_BUILDS=` flag.

There are several more package build options.  For example, it's possible to build a single package with all of its prerequisites.  For more details on package building options, see [Packages](#packages).

#### Rebuild All Packages

The following command rebuilds all CBL-Mariner packages.

**A reminder that you can build packages outside the core repo (which is often much faster). Refer to the [CBL-MarinerTutorials](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-MarinerTutorials) repository for examples.**

```bash
# Build ALL packages on a *stable* branch (i.e. 1.0-stable, 2.0-stable, etc)
# (NOTE: CBL-Mariner compiles natively, an ARM64 build machine is required to create ARM64 packages/images)

sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE="" REBUILD_TOOLS=y
```

```bash
# Build ALL packages on an *unstable* branch
# (NOTE: CBL-Mariner compiles natively, an ARM64 build machine is required to create ARM64 packages/images)

# QUICKREBUILD=y sets both QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=y and QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y

# QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=y implies the following flags:
#   DELTA_BUILD   = y
#   USE_CCACHE   ?= y
#   REBUILD_TOOLS = y

# QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y builds the toolchain as quickly as possible by using publicly available packages from our public package repo.
# See the toolchain section for more details.

sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE="" QUICKREBUILD=y
#  ---or---
sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE="" QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=y TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=~/mariner_toolchain.tar.gz
```

#### Rebuild Minimal Required Packages

The following command rebuilds packages for the basic VHD on the **stable** branch.

```bash
# Build the subset of packages needed to build the basic VHD on a *stable* branch (i.e. 1.0-stable, 2.0-stable, etc)
# (NOTE: CBL-Mariner compiles natively, an ARM64 build machine is required to create ARM64 packages/images)

# We do not use QUICKREBUILD or QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN since this is a stable branch and we
# want to just download the toolchain

sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/core-legacy.json QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=y
```

Note that the image config file passed to the `CONFIG_FILE` option _only_ builds the packages included in the image config plus all packages needed to build/run those packages. In other words, rather than the entirety of the CBL-Mariner repo being built, only the packages needed by the image config and the dependencies for those packages will be built.

#### Targeted Package Building

Beginning with the `CBL-Mariner 2.0`'s 2022 October Release (`2.0.20221007`), it is possible to rapidly build one or more packages "in-tree".  This technique can be helpful for modifying an existing SPEC file or adding a new one to CBL-Mariner.

We do this by limiting the packages the toolkit knows about by only packaging the desired SRPMS via `SRPM_PACK_LIST`. Also recall that individual packages can be developed outside the core repo, refer to the [CBL-MarinerTutorials](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-MarinerTutorials) repo for details.

|Argument|Use|
|:-|-|
| SRPM_PACK_LIST | Only package these `.spec` files for further processing |
| PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST | Build this package, and any dependencies we know about **if they have not been built**|
| PACKAGE_REBUILD_LIST | **ALWAYS** rebuild this package, even if we don't think we need to |

```bash
# Clear any existing packages that the tools might know about
sudo make clean-input-srpms clean-expand-specs

# Build targeted packages
packages="openssh at"
sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) QUICKREBUILD=y SRPM_PACK_LIST="$packages"
```

Note that this process will download dependencies from [packages.microsoft.com](packages.microsoft.com) and rebuild just the `.spec` files indicated by the `SRPM_PACK_LIST`

After building a package, you may choose to rebuild it or build additional packages.

```bash
# Clean and rebuild targeted packages, but only if they are missing
sudo make clean-build-packages
sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) QUICKREBUILD=y CONFIG_FILE="" SRPM_PACK_LIST="at openssh"

# Force the 'at' package to rebuild no matter what, and build openssh if it is missing
sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) QUICKREBUILD=y CONFIG_FILE="" SRPM_PACK_LIST="at openssh" PACKAGE_REBUILD_LIST="at" PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST="openssh"
```

### Image Stage

Different images and image formats can be produced from the build system.  Images are assembled from a combination of _Image Configuration_ files and _package list_ files.  Each [Package List](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-MarinerTutorials#package-lists) file (in [toolkit/imageconfigs/packagelists](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner/tree/2.0/toolkit/imageconfigs/packagelists)) describes a set of packages to install in an image.  Each Image Configuration file defines the image output format and selects one or more _package lists_ to include in the image.

By default, the `make image` and `make iso` commands (discussed below) will build any locally defined packages referenced in the config file before starting the image build sequence.  By adding the `REBUILD_PACKAGES=n` argument, the image build phase will instead download all packages from [packages.microsoft.com](packages.microsoft.com). This can accelerate the image build process, especially when performing [Targeted Package Building](#targeted-package-building).

All images are generated in the `out/images` folder.

#### Virtual Hard Disks and Containers

```bash
# Recall that if you are on a stable branch you can omit the toolchain rebuild. If so
# use QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=y instead of QUICKREBUILD=y.

# To build a CBL-Mariner VHD Image (VHD folder: ../out/images/core-legacy)
sudo make image CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/core-legacy.json QUICKREBUILD=y

# To build a CBL-Mariner VHDX Image (VHDX folder ../out/images/core-efi)
sudo make image CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/core-efi.json QUICKREBUILD=y

# To build a core CBL-Mariner Container (Container Folder: ../out/images/core-container/*.tar.gz)
sudo make image CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/core-container.json QUICKREBUILD=y
```

#### ISO Images

ISOs are bootable images that install CBL-Mariner to either a physical or virtual machine.  The installation process can be manually guided through user prompting, or automated through unattended installation.

NOTE: ISOs require additional packaging and build steps (such as the creation of a separate `initrd` installer image used to install the final image to disk).  These additional resources are stored in the [toolkit/resources/imagesconfigs](../../../toolkit/resources/imageconfigs/) folder.

The following builds an ISO with an interactive UI and selectable image configurations:

```bash
# Recall that if you are on a stable branch you can omit the toolchain rebuild. If so
# use QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=y instead of QUICKREBUILD=y.

# To build a CBL-Mariner ISO Image (ISO folder: ../out/images/full)
sudo make iso CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/full.json QUICKREBUILD=y
```

To create an unattended ISO installer (no interactive UI), use `UNATTENDED_INSTALLER=y` and run with a [`CONFIG_FILE`](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-MarinerTutorials#image-config-file) that only specifies a _single_ SystemConfig. The image config requires additional information, see [image config format](../formats/imageconfig.md#targetdisk) for more details.

```bash
# Recall that if you are on a stable branch you can omit the toolchain rebuild. If so
# use QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=y instead of QUICKREBUILD=y.

# Build the standard ISO with unattended installer that installs onto the default Gen1 HyperV VM. Needs to cloud-init provision the user once unattended installation finishes.
sudo make iso -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/core-legacy-unattended-hyperv.json QUICKREBUILD=y UNATTENDED_INSTALLER=y
```

## Further Reading

This section covers additional details about the build system such as build configuration flags and other advanced topics.

### Packages

The toolkit can download packages from remote RPM repositories, or build them locally. By default any `*.spec` files found in `SPECS_DIR="./SPECS"` will be built locally. Dependencies will be downloaded as needed. Only those packages needed to build the current [config](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-MarinerTutorials#image-config-file) will be built (`core-efi.json` by default). An additional space separated list of packages may be added using the `PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST=` variable.

Build all local packages needed for the default `core-efi.json`:

```bash
sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc)
```

Build only two packages along with their prerequisites (note `CONFIG_FILE` is explicitly cleared, not specifying it will use the default `core-efi.json` config):

```bash
sudo make build-packages PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST="vim nano" CONFIG_FILE= -j$(nproc)
```

Build packages from a custom SPECS dir:

```bash
sudo make build-packages SPECS_DIR="/my/packages/SPECS" -j$(nproc)
```

### Working on Packages

The build system will attempt to minimize rebuilds, but sometimes it is useful to force packages to rebuild, or ignore missing packages. Say you want to iterate on the `nano` package, but the `ncurses-devel` package is broken (`ncurses-devel` is a dependency of `nano`)...

#### DOWNLOAD_SRPMS

When `DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=y` is set, the local sources and spec files will not be used, and changes will not be reflected in the final packages.

#### Force Rebuilds

Adding `PACKAGE_REBUILD_LIST="nano"` will tell the build system to always rebuild `nano.spec` even if it thinks the rpm file is up to date.

#### Ignoring Packages

In the event the ncurses package is currently having issues, `PACKAGE_IGNORE_LIST="ncurses"` will tell the build system to pretend the `ncurses.spec` file was already successfully built regardless of the actual local state. As before, explicitly clear the `CONFIG_FILE` variable to skip adding `core-efi.json`'s packages.

```bash
# Work on the nano package while ignoring the state of the ncurses package
sudo make build-packages PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST="nano" PACKAGE_REBUILD_LIST="nano" PACKAGE_IGNORE_LIST="ncurses" CONFIG_FILE=
```

Any build which requires the ignored packages will still attempt to use them during a build, so ensure they are available in the `../out/RPMS` folder.

#### Source Hashes

The build system also enforces hash checking for sources when packaging SRPMs. For a given `*.spec` file a hash of each source is recorded in `*.signatures.json`. The build system will attempt to find a source which matches the recorded hash. If you change a source the signature file can be updated by setting `SRPM_FILE_SIGNATURE_HANDLING=update`, or invoking the `sha256sum` command and manually editing the signature file.

```bash
# Just update the intermediate SRPMs and their source signatures by using the input-srpms target
sudo make input-srpms SRPM_FILE_SIGNATURE_HANDLING=update
```

### packages.microsoft.com Repository Structure

CBL-Mariner packages are available on [packages.microsoft.com](https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/). The CBL-Mariner repositories are divided into major release folders (1.0, 2.0, etc). Each top level folder is subdivided into "preview" and "production" (prod) repositories.

The "preview" and "production" folders are further subdivided into purpose, and then again for architecture. This includes locations for source-rpms.

#### CBL-Mariner 1.0

For CBL-Mariner 1.0, the repositories are structured as follows:

- **Base:** Packages released with CBL-Mariner 1.0.
- **Update:** Base packages added or updated since CBL-Mariner 1.0's release date.
- **CoreUI:** Targeted UI related packages.
- **Extras:** CBL-Mariner 1.0 packages that are built by Microsoft and are closed source.
- **NVIDIA:** Specially licensed NVIDIA packages.
- **Microsoft:** Packages built by other, non-CBL-Mariner, Microsoft teams.

#### CBL-Mariner 2.0

For CBL-Mariner 2.0, the repositories are structured as follows:

- **Base:** Packages released with CBL-Mariner 2.0 and their updates.
- **Extras:** CBL-Mariner 2.0 packages that are built by Microsoft and are closed source
- **Extended:** CBL-Mariner 2.0 packages that are not considered part of core. Generally, viewed as experimental or for development purposes.
- **NVIDIA:** Specially licensed NVIDIA packages.
- **Microsoft:** Packages built by other, non-CBL-Mariner, Microsoft teams.

## Keys, Certs, and Remote Sources

### Sources

The build system pulls files two ways:

- Downloading files directly.
- Using the `tdnf` package management tool running inside a chroot.

Direct file downloads are by default pulled from:

```makefile
SOURCE_URL         ?=
PACKAGE_URL_LIST   ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)/prod/base/$(build_arch)
SRPM_URL_LIST      ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)/prod/base/srpms
```

While `tdnf` uses a list of repo files:

```makefile
REPO_LIST ?=
```

The `REPO_LIST` variable supports multiple repo files, and they are prioritized in the order they appear in the list.
The CBL-Mariner base repo is implicitly provided and an optional preview repo is available by setting `USE_PREVIEW_REPO=y`.
If `DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=y` is set, any repo that is accessed through the network is disabled.

### Authentication

If supplying custom endpoints for source/SRPM/package servers, accessing these resources may require keys and certificates. The keys and certificates can be set using:

```bash
sudo make image CA_CERT=/path/to/rootca.crt TLS_CERT=/path/to/user.crt TLS_KEY=/path/to/user.key
```

## Tools

The core of the build system is broken into several parts: A controlling Makefile, scripts to build the toolchain, and Go tools to build packages and images.

### How it Works

There is an in-depth guide on how the build tools hook together in [How it Works](../how_it_works/0_intro.md).

### Building Go Tools

The Go tools can be built with the following command:

```bash
sudo make go-tools REBUILD_TOOLS=y
```

This will gather the required go modules, compile the shared modules and all tools, and run all unit tests. There is a summary of the go tools here: [Go Tools](../how_it_works/1_initial_prep.md#go-tools-1)

When developing the tools it can be useful to invoke the automatic formatter with:

```bash
sudo make go-tidy-all
```

See [Dedicated Go Tooling Guide](./dedicated_guides/build_tools.md) for more details on working with the Go tools.

Details on how the Go tools are compiled can be found in [Go Tools Compiling](../how_it_works/5_misc.md#go-tools-compiling)

## Building Everything From Scratch

**NOTE: Source files must be made available for all packages. They can be placed manually in the corresponding SPEC/\* folders, `SOURCE_URL=<YOUR_SOURCE_SERVER>` may be provided, or DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=y may be used to use pre-packages sources. Core CBL-Mariner source packages are available at `SOURCE_URL=https://cblmarinerstorage.blob.core.windows.net/sources/core`**

The build system can operate without using any pre-built components at all if desired. There are several variables which enable/disable build components and sources of data. They are listed here along with their default values:

```makefile
SOURCE_URL         ?= https://cblmarinerstorage.blob.core.windows.net/sources/core
PACKAGE_URL_LIST   ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)/prod/base/$(build_arch)
SRPM_URL_LIST      ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)/prod/base/srpms
REPO_LIST          ?=
```

```makefile
DOWNLOAD_SRPMS         ?= n
REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN      ?= n
REBUILD_PACKAGES       ?= y
REBUILD_TOOLS          ?= n
DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS ?= n
TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE      ?=
PACKAGE_ARCHIVE        ?=
```

See [Local Build Variables](#local-build-variables) for details on what each variable does.

### Bootstrapping the Toolchain and Building Everything from Scratch

This command will build all components locally, including all toolchain packages using a two stage bootstrap process. No sources will be pulled remotely **(Unless a package build explicitly attempts to do so within its `*.spec` file)**.

Just the toolchain build will take several hours, building `core-efi.json` may take the better part of a day.

```bash
# NOTE: It is only necessary to call the final command, but each stage is broken out on its own for clarity.

# Rebuild just the Go tools
sudo make go-tools REBUILD_TOOLS=y

# Bootstrap just the toolchain using publicly available sources via wget (or from SOURCE_URL if set),
#  then rebuild the toolchain properly using the provided sources
# NOTE: Source files must made available via one of:
# - `SOURCE_URL=<YOUR_SOURCE_SERVER>`
# - DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=y (will download pre-packages sources from SRPM_URL_LIST=...)
# - manually placing the correct sources in each /SPECS/* package folder
#     (SRPM_FILE_SIGNATURE_HANDLING=update must be used if the new sources files do not match the existing hashes)
sudo make toolchain PACKAGE_URL_LIST="" REPO_LIST="" DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=y REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y REBUILD_TOOLS=y
```

```bash
# Complete rebuild of all tool, package, and image files from source necessary to build the default image config.
# NOTE: Source files must made available via one of:
# - `SOURCE_URL=<YOUR_SOURCE_SERVER>`
# - DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=y (will download pre-packages sources from SRPM_URL_LIST=...)
# - manually placing the correct sources in each /SPECS/* package folder
#     (SRPM_FILE_SIGNATURE_HANDLING=update must be used if the new sources files to not match the existing hashes)
sudo make image PACKAGE_URL_LIST="" REPO_LIST="" DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=y REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y REBUILD_PACKAGES=y REBUILD_TOOLS=y
```

### Local Build Variables

#### Quickrebuild Defaults

Quickrebuild flags will set some flags to try and optimize builds for speed. This involves using as many packages as possible from the upstream repos for both package building and for toolchain creation. These flags are meant to work on any branch.

#### `QUICKREBUILD=...`

##### `QUICKREBUILD=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Do not set any additional quickbuild flags

##### `QUICKREBUILD=`**`y`**

> If they are not set, set `QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y` and `QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=y`.

#### `QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=...`

##### `QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Do not set toolchain specific quick rebuild flags

##### `QUICKREBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=`**`y`**

> Set `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN = y`, `INCREMENTAL_TOOLCHAIN = y`, `ALLOW_TOOLCHAIN_DOWNLOAD_FAIL = y`, `REBUILD_TOOLS ?= y`.

#### `QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=...`

##### `QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Do not set toolchain specific quick rebuild flags

##### `QUICKREBUILD_PACKAGES=`**`y`**

> Set `DELTA_BUILD = y`, `REBUILD_TOOLS ?= y`, `REBUILD_TOOLS ?= y`.

#### URLS and Repos

The build can be configured to prioritize local builds but still use the remote sources if needed. For example: If a locally defined `*.spec` file has build dependencies which are not satisfied locally.

If that is not desired all remote sources can be disabled by clearing the following variable:

#### `SOURCE_URL=...`

> URL to download unavailable source files from when creating `*.src.rpm` files prior to build. Only one URL can be set at a time; there is no support for a list of multiple source URLs.

#### `PACKAGE_URL_LIST=...`

> Space separated list of URLs to download toolchain RPM packages from, used to populate the toolchain packages if `$(REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN)` is set to `y`.

#### `SRPM_URL_LIST=...`

> Space separated list of URLs to download packed SRPM packages from prior to build if `$(DOWNLOAD_SRPMS)` is set to `y`.

#### `REPO_LIST=...`

> Space separated list of `.repo` files pointing to RPM repositories to pull packages from. These packages are used to satisfy dependencies during the build process and to compose a final image. Locally available packages are always prioritized. The repos are prioritized based on the order they appear in the list. i.e., repos earlier in the list are higher priority. **If you are using the pre-packaged CBL-Mariner toolkit**, a set of pre-populated RPM repositories are accessible inside the toolkit folder under `toolkit/repos`. If you are **using the core repo** instead of the pre-packaged, toolkit the repo files are available in `SPECS/mariner-repos/`.
>
> - `mariner-official-base.repo` and `mariner-official-update.repo` - default, always-on CBL-Mariner repositories.
> - `mariner-preview.repo` - CBL-Mariner repository containing pre-release versions of RPMs **subject to change without notice**. Using this .repo file is equivalent to adding the [`USE_PREVIEW_REPO=y`](#use_preview_repoy) argument to your build command.
> - `mariner-extended.repo` and `mariner-extended-preview.repo` - CBL-Mariner repository that contains a larger range of packages which do not have a CVE or support SLA. Use these packages at your own risk.
> - `mariner-ui.repo` and `mariner-ui-preview.repo` - CBL-Mariner repository containing packages related to any UI components. The preview version serves the same purpose as the official preview repo.
> - `mariner-extras.repo` and `mariner-extras-preview.repo` - CBL-Mariner repository containing proprietary RPMs with sources not viewable to the public. The preview version serves the same purpose as the official preview repo.
>

#### Build Enable/Disable Flags

#### `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=...`

##### `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Use pre-existing toolchain packages from another source. If `TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=my_toolchain.tar.gz` is also set the build system will extract the required packages from that archive. If `TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE` is not set the build system will download the required toolchain packages from `$(PACKAGE_URL_LIST)`.

##### `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=`**`y`**

> Bootstrap the toolchain from the host environment in a docker container. The toolchain consists of those packages which are required to build all other packages (_gcc, tdnf, etc_)

#### `INCREMENTAL_TOOLCHAIN=...`

##### `INCREMENTAL_TOOLCHAIN=`**`n`** _(default)_

> If rebuilding the toolchain (`REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y`), perform a full build of the final toolchain packages. No RPMs from (a) previous failed builds or (b) upstream package repos will be reused.

##### `INCREMENTAL_TOOLCHAIN=`**`y`**

> Do not clear out the toolchain build chroot before performing a build of the final toolchain packages. RPMs within the toolchain build chroot will be used as a cache to avoid rebuilding already-built SRPMs. These RPMs can be seeded by (a) previous failed builds or (b) upstream package repos.

#### `ALLOW_TOOLCHAIN_DOWNLOAD_FAIL=...`

##### `ALLOW_TOOLCHAIN_DOWNLOAD_FAIL=`**`n`** _(default)_

> If performing an incremental toolchain build (`INCREMENTAL_TOOLCHAIN=y`), do not attempt to pull any packages from `$(PACKAGE_URL_LIST)`.

##### `ALLOW_TOOLCHAIN_DOWNLOAD_FAIL=`**`y`**

> If performing an incremental toolchain build (`INCREMENTAL_TOOLCHAIN=y`), attempt to pull as many RPMs listed in the arch-specific toolchain manifest from the repos listed in `$(PACKAGE_URL_LIST)`. These RPMs will used as a cache to avoid rebuilding already-built SRPMs.

#### `DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=...`

##### `DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Pack SRPMs to be built from local SPECs. Will retrieve sources from the SPEC's folder if available, and will download missing sources from `$(SOURCE_URL)`.

##### `DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=`**`y`**

> Download official pre-packed SRPMs from `$(SRPM_URL)`. Use this option if `$(SOURCE_URL)` is not available.

#### `USE_PREVIEW_REPO=...`

##### `USE_PREVIEW_REPO=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Do not pull missing packages from the upstream preview repository.

##### `USE_PREVIEW_REPO=`**`y`**

> Pull missing packages from the upstream preview repository in addition to the base repository.

#### `DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=...`

##### `DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Pull packages from all set repositories, including external ones accessed through the network.

##### `DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=`**`y`**

> Only pull missing packages from local repositories. This does not affect hydrating the toolchain from `$(PACKAGE_URL_LIST)`.

#### `REBUILD_PACKAGES=...`

##### `REBUILD_PACKAGES=`**`y`** _(default)_

> Parse all local `*.spec` files, and build them if needed.
> A package will be built
>
> - If:
>   - it is present in `CONFIG_FILE=config.json`
>   - or it is listed in `PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST="..."`
>   - or it is listed in `PACKAGE_REBUILD_LIST="..."`
>   - or it is a dependency of a package listed in one of the above
> - And:
>   - the corresponding *.rpm files are missing
>   - or the *.rpm files are out of date (based on version numbers)

**NOTE:**

The `*.spec` files are converted to `*.src.rpm` files which bundle the spec files with their source files. If the build tools are not able to find valid source files **which match the SHA1 hash recorded in `*.signatures.json`** then they will attempt to locate the source files from `$(SOURCE_URL)` and download them.

##### `REBUILD_PACKAGES=`**`n`**

> Do not attempt to build any local specs, always download the packages via `tdnf` from the internet if they are missing.

**NOTE:**

It is possible to hydrate the local `*.rpm` files with a one-time manual operation:

```bash
# Create ./out/rpms.tar.gz from the *.rpm files locally available:
sudo make compress-rpms
```

```bash
# Extract all rpms present in rpms.tar.gz into a build environment:
sudo make hydrate-rpms PACKAGE_ARCHIVE=./rpms.tar.gz
```

#### `REBUILD_TOOLS=...`

##### `REBUILD_TOOLS=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Use pre-compiled go binaries, likely provided as part of an SDK. The binaries are expected to be found in `$(TOOL_BINS_DIR)`

##### `REBUILD_TOOLS=`**`y`**

> Build the go tools from source as needed.

#### `REFRESH_WORKER_CHROOT=...`

##### `REFRESH_WORKER_CHROOT=`**`n`**

> If exists, don't attempt to rebuild the worker chroot, even if its build script, its manifest, or the packages it consists of have been modified in the local repository.

##### `REFRESH_WORKER_CHROOT=`**`y`** _(default)_

> Rebuild the worker chroot every time at least one of the following has changed:
>
> - worker chroot's manifest file,
> - at least one of the RPM packages mentioned in the manifest file, or
> - the script responsible for building the chroot.

#### `HYDRATED_BUILD=...`

##### `HYDRATED_BUILD=`**`y`**

> If exists, all the dependency RUN nodes will be replaced with PreBuilt Nodes if those RPMs are hydrated already. So if any dependency package fails to build, the subsequent dependent packages will not be stuck as their dependency will be satisfied by hydrated RPM. This is even applicable to the packages mentioned in REBUILD_PACKAGES.

##### `HYDRATED_BUILD=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Normal build. No hydrated RPMs will be used.

#### `DELTA_BUILD=...`

##### `DELTA_BUILD=`**`y`**

> Delta build. Used for fast delta builds where published packages are pre-populated and only new or added packages are built.

##### `DELTA_BUILD=`**`n`** _(default)_

> Normal build.

## All Build Targets

## Reproducing a Build

By default the build system will pull the highest possible version of external packages when building. However, there may be circumstances when you wish to reproduce a build using the exact same external package versions as before, even if newer versions are available.

### Build Summaries

The build system supports this behavior through summary files, a JSON representation of packages consumed during a build. By referencing these summary files, the build system can consume the exact same version of packages later on.

Since the summary files are regenerated every build, if you wish to reproduce a build, you should save the summary files to another location for future use.

| Type of Build                 | Summary File Location                                                                                  | Description
|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---
| Package Build                 | `$(PKGBUILD_DIR)/graph_external_deps.json`                                                             | Generated every package build. Can be saved and used later with the `PACKAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY` variable to reproduce a package build. Contains **only the external** packages required to build the local packages.
| Image Build                   | `$(IMAGEGEN_DIR)/{imagename}/image_deps.json`                                                          | Generated every image build. Can be saved and used later with the `IMAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY` variable to reproduce an image build. Contains **all (both external and local)** packages required to build the image.
| Initrd Build                  | `$(IMAGEGEN_DIR)/iso_initrd/image_deps.json`                                                           | Generated every initrd and ISO build. Can be saved and used later with the `INITRD_CACHE_SUMMARY` variable to reproduce an initrd build. Contains **all (both external and local)** packages required to build the image. However, unless you modified the initrd image packages JSON or have your own version of its PMC packages locally, all the required packages are external.

**WARNING**: the `graph_external_deps.json` contains **ALL** external packages required to build your local spec files. If you depend on any external packages outside the core CBL-Mariner's PMC repository, you **MUST** make sure you still have access to them when attempting to reproduce a build.

### Building From Summaries

To reproduce a build, there are four constraints:

1. The local SPEC files must be the same. That is, you cannot reproduce a build having modified any of the local SPEC files since when the summary files were generated.
2. What is being built must be the same. That is, if the summary files were generated from an image build then the reproduced build must be building the exact same image configuration.
3. The toolkit version must be the same. That is, if the summary files were generated from a `2.0` toolkit, then the reproduced build must be done using the `2.0` toolkit.
4. The builds must be from clean. Both the build that generated the summary files and the reproduced build must be done from a clean state, otherwise there may be leftover files that affect the summary files. The only exception is the mentioned case of using external packages not present in the PMC repository - in this case you'll need to pre-populate the local cache with these packages after cleaning your repository, but before running the build.

If the above constraints are met then a build can be reproduced from summary files.

### Reproducing a Package Build

To reproduce a package build, run the same make invocation as before, but set:

- `PACKAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY=<path>` to the path of the package build summary file.

### Reproducing an Image Build

To reproduce an image build, run the same make invocation as before, but set:

- `PACKAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY=<path>` to the path of the package build summary file.
- `IMAGE_CACHE_SUMMMARY=<path>` to the path of the image build summary file.

### Reproducing an ISO Build

To reproduce an ISO build, run the same make invocation as before, but set:

- `PACKAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY=<path>` to the path of the package build summary file.
- `IMAGE_CACHE_SUMMMARY=<path>` to the path of the image build summary file.
- `INITRD_CACHE_SUMMMARY=<path>` to the path of the initrd build summary file.
