# Note: Current rootfs unpacks to be fairly big. 2GB memory was not enough size to hold the unpacked initramfs
# so when QEMU ran, it would fail with:
#
# [   16.532507] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0) ]---
#
# But this is a lie - the true error is immediately after the unpacking initramfs message:
#
# [    0.321246] Unpacking initramfs...
# [   15.549898] Initramfs unpacking failed: write error
#
# 4GB can hold the current rootfs. But tweak the -m parameter as necessary.
